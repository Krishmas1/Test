## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` or Quarto (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. 


**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use the Rmd templates of the class slides. 

- You can also use Quarto to create the presentation: *In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> Quarto Presentation...*
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can use `![](image.png){width="60%"}` or follow these below instructions.

    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

**Notice**

- Since this is a large dataset, you could try to run the codes on the smaller dataset, which is a portion of the original dataset before running the codes on the original data.  To create a random subset of the data you could use

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  
2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 

```{r}
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
df = read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```


    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)
```{r}
df = df %>% 
  filter(yod==18)
```

4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r}
                    df= df %>% select( "yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
```
 

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  Also notice that, empty values in the data before writing to csv may turn to NAs later when you re-read the file. 
```{r}
write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df = read_csv('midterm.csv')
```

 

6. Remove all variables with missing values. 
```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```


```{r}
df2 = df %>% select("yod","pay_ub92","age","sex","provider","moa","yoa","mod",      "los","service","icu","ccu","dispub92","payer","drg","trandb","randbg","randbs","orr","anes","seq","lab","dtest","ther","blood","phar","other","patcon","total","tot","b_wt","ancilar","campus","er_fee","er_chrg","obs_chrg","psycchrg" )
```

```{r}
write_csv(df2, 'midterm2.csv')
```

7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?

df2 %>% 
  filter(df$sex == 1) %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>% 
  count(moa) %>% 
  arrange(-n)

##When looking at all patients and only male patients, in both cases the month with the most admissions was October.
```

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
df2 %>% 
filter(df$sex == 2| age>12,age<20) %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>%

```

11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(df$sex == 1) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age))
df2 %>% 
  filter(df$sex == 2) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age))
##No males are older
```


12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?

```{r}
df2 %>%

  summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-mean_age)

##January
```


13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?

  summarise(mean = mean(tot))
#$34,529.70
```


17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points.

```{r}
## This section laregly looked at the specifics of the large dataset, trying to narrow down the various demographics as they relate to things like total charge. The analysis I performed was also only looking at the year 2018, perhaps due to the sheer volume of the data. Overall, when looking at sex, females contributed for significantly more of hospital patients than men. It was interesting however, because the difference between the total charge between men and women didn't seem to be too great, although of course women still had a greater total charge. Rhode Island Hospital also had the most total charge, which may indicate that it is a popular hospital that recieves lots of patients. October seems to also be a very busy month for hospitals as it hosts the most amount of patients at that time. Next, it's time to look at the various visualzations and what they mean.
```

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot()+geom_point(aes(x=provider, y=tot)) +
labs(
    title = "Total Cost By Provider",
    x = "Provider",      
    y = "Total Charge",  
    caption = "Aside from two- Rhode Island Hospital and Women and Infants, most of the providers have similar charges" 
  )
##Although 7205 and 7214 are the most cost, they have the most outliers as well.
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot()+geom_density(aes(x= los)) +
   labs(
    title = "Density Distrubution Of LOS",
    x = "Length Of Stay",     
    y = "Density",   
    caption = "The length of stay in days was most densely populated around 5-10 days" 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = age)) +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot Range of Age",
    x = "Age",     
    y = "",   
    caption = "Ages range generally from 30-70, with the mean being around the high 50s." 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex)) +
  labs(
    title = "Patients by Sex",
    x = "Sex (1 or 2)",     
    y = "",   
    caption = "There are significantly more female patients than male" 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(df2$age>=30) %>% 
  ggplot()+geom_line(aes(x=age, y=los)) +
  labs(
    title = "Total LOS By Age (Age>=30)",
    x = "Age",     
    y = "Length Of Stay",   
    caption = "When looking at age greater than 30, from 30-50 is the most los" 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=los, y=tot)) +
  labs(
    title = "Total Charge By Lenghth Of Stay",
    x = "Length Of Stay",     
    y = "Total Charge",   
    caption = "Either high or low LOS, no in between. This results in varying total charges." 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = sex, y=tot)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Total Charge By Sex",
    x = "Sex (1 or 2)",     
    y = "Total Charge",   
    caption = "Although there are more female patients, total charge doesn't differ by much" 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(df2$age>=30) %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=age, y=tot)) +
  labs(
    title = "Total Charge By Age",
    x = "Age",     
    y = "Total Charge",   
    caption = "From the ages of 0-55,total charge is highest. After that charges taper off" 
  )
```

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = service, y=tot)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Total Charge By Service",
    x = "Service",     
    y = "Total Charge",   
    caption = "Could be an error here but 00 seems to be all service except psychiatry" 
  )
```
```{r}
df2 %>% 
  ggplot()+geom_density(aes(x=age, color= sex)) +
   labs(
    title = "Age Density",
    x = "Age",     
    y = "Density",   
    caption = "Another look at Age here, the most patients were densely populated at age 60 " 
  )
```


```{r}
library(gganimate)
df2 %>% 
filter(provider %in% c('7201','7202','7203')) %>% 
ggplot(aes(y=tot,
            x=moa,
            color=provider))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  transition_reveal(moa)
```

2. Make an animation plot. 

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 
```{r}
## One of the first things I looked at when making these visulations was a boxplot of the range of the ages. The data mostly ranged from ages 30-70, with some outliers being newborn and the elderly. The average was in the high 50s, around the age of 57. This makes sense as it is a little higher than middle age. I also looked at length of stay as it pertains to total charge. Of course, the longer one stays, the higher total charge will be. However, I thought it was interesting how patients either stayed for a few days or many days, there wasn't much of a middle ground. Perhaps this is due to the fact that hospitals are expensive in the U.S. That being the case, most try to minimize their visit to a few days at most. However those who aren't able to that might be under some kind of long term intensive care. Rhode Island Hopital and Women and Infants Hospital have the highest charges out of all the other providers.
```

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 

```{r}
library(haven)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
df3 = read_csv('midterm.csv')

df3 = df3 %>% select("age","sex","provider","moa","mod","campus", "los", "tot")


df3$target <- ifelse(df3$tot<median(df3$tot), 
                        'low','high')
  
df3 = df3 %>% select(-tot)  
  
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df3$target, p = .10, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df3[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df3[-splitIndex,]
```


2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 

```{r}
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
tree_model$variable.importance
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
```


3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 

```{r}
library(caret)
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:5))
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(forest_ranger)
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
df_test$target <- as.factor(df_test$target)
pred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(df_test$target))
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm$overall[1]
```

```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:5))
forest_ranger2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "lda", 
                                trControl = trControl)
pred <- predict(forest_ranger2, df_test)
df_test$target <- as.factor(df_test$target)
pred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(df_test$target))
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm$overall[1]
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 
```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)
forest_ranger <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
forest_ranger2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "lda", 
                                trControl = trControl)
results <- resamples(list('Ranger' = forest_ranger,
                          'LDA'=forest_ranger2 ))
bwplot(results)
##Final Selection is Ranger model as it has a higher accuracy by a little bit
```



5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data.

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 

```{r}

df3$target <- ifelse(df3$tot<mean(df3$tot), 
                        'low','high')
  
df3 = df3 %>% select(-tot)  
  
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df3$target, p = .10, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df3[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df3[-splitIndex,]
```

```{r}
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))

tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:5))
forest_ranger3 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)
plot(forest_ranger3)
pred <- predict(forest_ranger3, df_test)
df_test$target <- as.factor(df_test$target)
pred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(df_test$target))

                       splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:5))
forest_ranger4 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "lda", 
                                trControl = trControl)

results <- resamples(list('Ranger' = forest_ranger,
                          'LDA'=forest_ranger2 ))
bwplot(results)
##Final selection is ranger
```

7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

```{r}
## In the final part of the project, we looked at the use of multiple models to predict a target variable. We first looked at the target variable as the median of the total charge, trying to determine whether the total charge was greater than the median or not. I used the Ranger and LDA models for this. From it, I found that the Ranger was the better model accuracy wise. When I redid this code but looking for the mean of the total charge, I came up with better accuracy results from both ranger and LDA. However, I still found that ranger was the better method.   
```
